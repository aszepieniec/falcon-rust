# Falcon-Rust

Unofficial rust implementation of the [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/) post-quantum
digital signature scheme.

Falcon was submitted to the [NIST PQC](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography)
standardization project and was [selected](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-algorithms-2022) for 
standardization. The final standard is still outstanding. We do anticipate slight changes
between the standard and the submission, and these changes might break compatibility.

Falcon comes in two variants. Falcon512 claims at least 108 bits of security, and
Falcon1024 claims at least 252 bits of security, both against quantum computers.

This implementation was written following the [specification](https://falcon-sign.info/falcon.pdf)
and the official [python implementation](https://github.com/tprest/falcon.py).

## Example

```rust
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let mut msg : [u8; 5] = rng.gen();
let (sk, pk) = falcon512::keygen(rng.gen());
let sig = falcon512::sign(&msg, &sk);
assert!(falcon512::verify(&msg, &sig, &pk));
```

## Performance

Performance is still inferior to the optimized C code accessible from rust via the [foreign function interface](https://crates.io/crates/pqcrypto-falcon) "`pqcrypto-falcon`". These measurements were taken on my Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10750H CPU @
2.60GHz (which supports AVX2). You can make your own by running `cargo bench`.
